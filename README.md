# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the provided csv files of school data and search for patterns that might indicate that the 9th grade math and reading scores of Thomas High School had been altered. In this analysis we changed the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School to nan and searched for any significant changes in the data frames.
## Results
### District Summary
•	Removing the ninth grader’s data from the district summary had a very slight and insignificant affect on the data frame. The average math score went up by 0.9 percent as did the average reading score. The percentage passing math and reading changed by 0.8 and 0.7 percentage respectively, and the overall passing percent went up by 0.9 percent.

### School Summary
•	The school summary was more significantly affected. While the average math and reading scores were only changed by a fraction of a percent, the percent passing math, reading, and passing overall decreased by almost 30 percent.

•	As seems to be the general trend, the scores by school type were insignificantly altered. None of the changes surpassed half a percent.

## Summary 

As previously stated, the changes to the data frames were quite insignificant. The difference in the values almost never exceeded a full percent. The only real change was in the school summary. The passing percentages in this data frame plummeted by almost 30 percent. The school summary did a great job analyzing the schools individually. In the other data frames the volume of data from multiple schools minimalized the effect of changing one data point.
